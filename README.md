# Veducate
Compressed educational video content for Viasat Community WiFi. Give the gift of learning to everyone!

<h3>About Community WiFi</h3>
Community WiFi is a new business group at Viasat focused on providing satellite internet hotspots to the most remote areas of the world, where people do not have internet connectivity. The possibilities for social impact include improving educational access, increasing economic mobility, improving communication between friends and families, and much more.

<h3>Veducate</h3>
Veducate is an initiative proposed for Viasat-provided educational video content provided in mobile-quality and framerates optimized for low-data hotspot plans. This will allow Community WiFi users to consume more educational content at a lower cost and take full advantage of their new satellite internet.

Included in this repo are a React App that plays locally-hosted, compressed educational videos, a script to automate the video compression by using the Handbrake video compression tool, a mock-up of the Veducate video portal, and Veducate marketing material.
